# Proxy-Aware Web Scraper

The Proxy-Aware Web Scraper is a Python-based program that allows you to scrape data from websites while utilizing proxies. Proxies act as intermediary servers, enabling you to route your web requests through different IP addresses, enhancing anonymity and bypassing certain restrictions set by websites. Using proxies can help prevent IP blocking, rate limiting, and other anti-scraping measures.

## Features

- Scrapes real estate data from a user-specified website.
- Stores the scraped data in an SQLite database for easy retrieval and analysis.
- Automated web scraping with proxy support.
- Enhances anonymity and reduces the risk of IP blocks.
- Bypasses rate-limiting restrictions on target websites.
- Simple command-line interface for easy usage.
- Data extraction from multiple pages and websites.
